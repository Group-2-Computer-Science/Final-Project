The objective for the question is display the number from first to last and from last to first in array. 
From first to last, we can use the for loop to start form index=0, index++ util the last one and then display the index. 
From last to first, we also use for loop to start from index=array.length  and then index--. 
So it can display the number from last to first. The key of the question is the for loop condition.
